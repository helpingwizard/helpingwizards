## 🧵 Problem Statement: ReWear – Community Clothing Exchange

Develop **ReWear**, a 🌐 web-based platform that enables users to exchange unused clothing through direct swaps 🔁 or a point-based redemption system 💱. The goal is to promote **sustainable fashion** ♻️ and reduce **textile waste** 🧺 by encouraging users to reuse wearable garments 👕 instead of discarding them 🗑️.
